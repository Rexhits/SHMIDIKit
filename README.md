# SHMIDIKit

## A lightweight MIDI framework for iOS and macOS, create virtual MIDI source, parse data into MIDI packet and send them out to DAWs.

### Installation
SHMIDKit is written in Swift 4.2, so your code has to be written in Swift 4.x due to current binary compatibility limitations.

### CocoaPods
To use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) add SHMIDIKit to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'SHMIDIKit'
end
```
